## ✨ Why Data Science + Media Buying?

The marketing industry is drowning in data but starving for insight. Most media buyers rely on gut feeling; most data scientists live in isolation. I bridge that gap by:

- 📉 **Questioning assumptions** – Using statistical rigor to validate campaign decisions
- 🎯 **Optimizing spend** – Turning data into lower CPC, higher ROAS, better conversions
- 🚀 **Scaling growth** – Building systems that work harder, not costing more
- 📊 **Telling stories** – Making data accessible to stakeholders who need to act on it

---

## 🎧 Personal Notes

- 📖 I believe data storytelling is the ultimate superpower—turning numbers into narratives that change minds
- 🎵 When I'm not analyzing data or optimizing campaigns, I'm probably listening to spiritual songs or Kaystrings
- 🤝 Always open to **collaborating on data science projects**, **marketing analytics work**, or **building dashboards** that drive real business impact
- 🚀 If you're building a data-driven marketing strategy, let's talk!

## 🌟 Thanks for stopping by!

**Let's turn data into smarter decisions and better marketing outcomes.** 💪📊
